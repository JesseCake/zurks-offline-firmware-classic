mount -o remount,rw /
cp -ir all the files keeping the directory structure intact one directory at a time (careful!).
cp debugchumbyearly to /psp/rfs1/userhook1
cp debugchumby to /psp/rfs1/userhook2
edit the files debugchumby, debugchumbyearly, zwapi.sh making sure all references to /mnt/usb go to a non readonly location like /tmp

edit the file :
/usr/chumby/scripts/start_control_panel
and replace /mnt/usb/controlpanel.swf (there are two occurrences) with the full path to wherever you dumped your control panel.
e.g. /controlpanel.swf
