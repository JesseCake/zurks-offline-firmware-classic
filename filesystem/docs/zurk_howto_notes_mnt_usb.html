<h1>Using Zurk's <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zurk/files/">offline chumby software</a> to convert a chumby 
one to offline use: booting from a usb drive</h1>
<i>galadriel's notes</i><br>
Based off discussions on <a href="http://forum.chumby.com/viewtopic.php?id=7831">forum.chumby.com</a>.<br><br>

Do I need to mention that you should probably test the software on your own chumby, following zurk's instructions, booting 
from the usb drive BEFORE making permanent changes?  Well, okay, there's the mention.  These instructions will tell you how to do it that 
way; if you're ready to make it permanent you can go <a href="zurk_howto_notes.html">to zurk_howto_notes.html</a> instead.

<br>
<br>
You'll do most of this while <a 
href="http://wiki.chumby.com/index.php/Chumby_tricks#Open_a_secure_shell_.28SSH.29_console_on_the_chumby">ssh'd into the 
chumby</a>, so make sure you're comfortable with that.  You'll need to know your chumby's IP (<b>your_chumbys_ip</b>) to ssh in and 
to make the backups beforehand (this is found on the chumby's info screen).  You'll also need to be able to use scp and ssh; 
if you're on a Windows machine, you may need to download putty.exe and pscp.exe from <a 
href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">here.<a/> <br><br> 
Any time you should just type a command at the command line, I'll put it in <code>code</code> so you can tell.  If you're 
using Windows, then you'll use "pscp" instead of "scp", and you'll use "putty" instead of "ssh".
<br>
<br>

<h2>Starting off</h2>
To be really safe, make backups of your chumby's current files. <a
href="http://wiki.chumby.com/index.php/Chumby_tricks#Open_a_secure_shell_.28SSH.29_console_on_the_chumby">Start up the ssh 
daemon on the chumby</a> so you can manipulate it directly.  Then open a command line on your primary computer. Type--or 
copy-and-paste--each of these commands on the command line, but replace <b>your_chumbys_ip</b> with your chumby's IP, of course. 
<br>


<code>
mkdir chumby_backup
<br>
cd chumby_backup
</code>
<br><br>

If you're on Windows and don't know much about ssh and scp, go ahead and get putty/pscp and put them here so they'll be 
right there for you to use:<br>
<code>
wget http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe
<br>
wget http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pscp.exe
</code>
<br><br>


Now continue with your backups:<br>
<code>
scp -r root@your_chumbys_ip:/psp .
<br>
scp -r root@your_chumbys_ip:/www .
<br>
mkdir usr/; mkdir usr/widgets/
<br>
scp root@your_chumbys_ip:/usr/widgets/controlpanel.swf usr/widgets/
</code>
<br>
<br>

Moving along.  Download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zurk/files/">zurk's offline chumby software</a> to your 
computer.  Plug in a usb drive to the computer, and extract the software to the usb drive.  Put the usb drive in the chumby.


<h2>Get your widgets</h2>
Move on over to the chumby now.  Make sure <a
href="http://wiki.chumby.com/index.php/Chumby_tricks#Open_a_secure_shell_.28SSH.29_console_on_the_chumby">sshd is started 
on the chumby</a>.  Then, from the command line on your primary computer:<br>
<code>
ssh root@your_chumbys_ip
</code>
<br><br>

Make a copy of zurk's original profiles file so you can refer to it later if you need to:<br>
<code>cp /mnt/usb/www/xml/profiles /mnt/usb/www/xml/profiles.bak</code>
<br><br>
On your account at <a href="http://www.chumby.com">chumby.com</a>, put all the widgets you want to download into one 
channel, then switch your chumby to that channel.
<br><br>
<center>- - - </center>
<br>
I'm just going to go ahead and use the converted-chumby /mnt/usb for all the directories, okay?  You'd use /www instead of /mnt/usb if you 
were ready to make this permanent.  The notes using the /www instead are <a href="zurk_howto_notes.html"> at zurk_howto_notes.html</a>.
<br><br>
<center>- - - </center>
<br><br>
You're ssh'd into your chumby.  Then after you:<br>
<code>stop_control_panel</code><br> and then<br>
<code>start_control_panel</code><br>
You'll see a lot of text zooming by.  At some point you'll see a URL.  The url will look something like this:<br>
<b>http://xml.chumby.com/xml/profiles?id=...</b>
<br><br>
Copy and wget that url; it's the profile for your active channel:<br>
<code>cd /mnt/usb/<br>
mkdir temp</br>
cd temp</br>
wget [the copied url]<br>
mv [the file that wget saved] /mnt/usb/www/xml/profiles</code>
<br>
<br>

If you're not sure what the file is called, you can check:<br>
<code>
ls
</code>

<br>
<br>
That will list the files in your current directory.  If you don't want to type out some huge filename, you can start typing 
it and then hit the TAB key.  The TAB will complete the filename for you. 
<br>
<br>

Now you'll edit that file. Open another command line on your primary computer (console, putty, etc) and ssh into your chumby 
again.  In that second window:<br>
<code>nano /mnt/usb/www/xml/profiles</code><br>
<br>
Start with a simple find-and-replace.  Where you see:<br>
<b>     &ltaccess access="public" deleteable="true" virtualable="true" sendable="true"/&gt</b><br>
replace the whole thing with the line in the "www/xml/profiles" file provided:<br>
<b>    &ltaccess sendable="false" deleteable="false" access="private" virtualable="false"/&gr</b>
<br><br>

Now, a more complicated find-and-replace.  Everything that looks like a URL in that file needs to have two things done to 
it.  First wget the URL and put the resulting file in /mnt/usb, and then change the entry in the file to point to /mnt/usb.  I'll 
show you how to do that.   For example, where my profiles file said:
<br><br>
    &ltmovie href="<b>http://s3movies.chumby.com/cdn/xmlmovie/2EEDFAB0-AA2D-11DC-AC8F-001635C47868</b>" 
contenttype="application/x-shockwave-flash"/&gt
<br>
<br>

I needed to go back to that first window, and at the command line:<br>
<code>wget http://s3movies.chumby.com/cdn/xmlmovie/2EEDFAB0-AA2D-11DC-AC8F-001635C47868<br>
mv 2EEDFAB0-AA2D-11DC-AC8F-001635C47868 /mnt/usb/</code><br>
<br>
and also in the second window, edit the line in the file so it read:<br>
    &ltmovie href="<b>file:////www/2EEDFAB0-AA2D-11DC-AC8F-001635C47868</b>"
contenttype="application/x-shockwave-flash"/&gt 
<br><br>

Repeat this for every URL in that file.
<br><br>

However!<br>
In some places you'll see things that look sort of like URL's, but they don't actually have a http:// and may 
not mention 
chumby.com.  For example:<br>
    &ltcategory href="<b>/xml/categories/EF508B70-2F35-11DB-8753-001372292121</b>" name="Clocks" 
id="EF508B70-2F35-11DB-8753-001372292121"/&gt 
<br><br>

What you'll need to do there is insert http://chumby.com into the beginning of the part that looks like a URL, and then wget 
the resulting whole URL, like so:<br>
<code>wget http://chumby.com/xml/categories/EF508B70-2F35-11DB-8753-001372292121<br>
mv EF508B70-2F35-11DB-8753-001372292121 /mnt/usb</code>
<br><br>

and then change the profiles file so it reads:<br>
    &ltcategory href="<b>file:////www/EF508B70-2F35-11DB-8753-001372292121</b>" name="Clocks"
id="EF508B70-2F35-11DB-8753-001372292121"/&gt 
<br><br>

Once you have found all of the URL's in the file, save and exit.  Hit "control-X" and then "Y" for yes.  you should have a 
working "profiles" file!  Your widgets are all saved right there on your chumby, and your profiles file will call them just 
like it used to when it was using the original chumby software.


<br><br>


<h2>To use zurk's software to boot up and run your chumby from the usb drive</h2>

Make sure that usb drive with ALL zurk's files is plugged into the chumby.  You've got your widgets in /mnt/usb/www and you've got your 
"profiles" in /mnt/usb/www/xml.  So, from the chumby's command line:<br>
<code>
reboot
</code>
<br><br>
And you should go right into it when it comes back up.  You're done!

<td>I've decided to release this rather than hang on to it. Its a simple method of downloading every single widget including all support files from the entire chumby network library.
<br>

Download it here including all source code : <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zurk/files/octopus.zip/download">http://sourceforge.net/projects/zurk/files/octopus.zip/download</a>
<br>

Octopus -- A chumby.com full catalog downloader.
<br>
by
<br>
Zurk
<br>
----
<br>

Download version 7 of java from <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a> and install it.
<br>

Create a new writeable directory and then go to a dos or unix prompt.
<br>

Type C:\<java path>\java octopus on Windows and the program will run.
<br>
or /<java path>/java octopus on UNIX and the program will run.
<br>
It will create 4 directories and download all XML files, widget SWFs and thumbnails.
<br>

You may pipe the output to a text file to examine it later. e.g.
<br>
/java/bin/java octopus > octopusoutput.txt
<br>

You can then open the output in a text editor to view which files were written where.
<br>

Note : This program requires network access and uses the chumby network heavily. Run it only once to back up all the widgets!

<td>not really. the chumby battery system is somewhat stupid.
<br>
edit the file :
<br>
/usr/chumby/scripts/power_state_changed.sh and remove all the hub lines. that should keep power on to the usb ports on battery.
<br>
wont help with the chumby charging batteries to the death problem tho. the whole charging system stupidity ensures batteries wont last more than a year or two tops even if unused.
